Developed By: Jones Jenkins<br/><br/>



1. Introduction<br/>
   1. Purpose<br/>
      a. This project documentation contains the Concept, How-To-Steps, and References for the game, Snake, designed in Python. This document is intended for developers and end users.<br/>
	 2. Scope<br/>
      a. This game is based on the classic game, Snake, which allows the user to navigate a snake throughout a game board to find and eat apples. The more apples the snake eats, the longer the snake becomes. Colliding with the edges of the board or the body of the snake will result in the end of the game.<br/>

         * Concept<br/>
         * How-To-Steps<br/>
   4. Resources<br/>
      a. The following resources were used in the production of this software application:<br/>

2. Concept<br/>
   - This application is an iteration of the popular game Snake. It consists of three screens:<br/>
     1. Main Menu - Introduces the game and allows the user to play the game, change song settings, or quit.<br/>
     2. Settings - Allows the user to change the music to one of three songs<br/>
     3. Game - User plays the game until the game ends. The user can then decide to play again or quit the game.<br/>
   - The sprites in the game were all custom made using Gimp:<br/>
     * Apple:<br/>

     * Snake Head:<br/>

	

3. How-To-Steps<br/>
   1. Open the project in a Python interpreter and run “Snake.py”.<br/>
   2. Press “C” to start a new game, or press “Q” to quit at the Main Menu.<br/>

   3. Use the arrow keys to move the snake left, right, up, and down to navigate towards and eat the apples on the gameboard.<br/>


   4. Colliding with the walls or the snake itself will result in the end of the game. Press “c” to play again, “m” to return to the main menu, or “q” to quit the game.<br/>

   5. Click the “Settings” button on the main menu to change the music in the settings window.<br/><br/>
